100 Python projects - from Beginner to Advanced <br>
[Syllabus](Syllabus.pdf)

This is my progression through:Â https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/

Try out the projects:

1. `Git clone https://github.com/jai-jk/100-days-of-python`.
2. Change into a specific directory i.e. `cd 22-pong`.
3. Install any dependencies listed at the the top of project files with pip3 i.e `pip3 install twilio`.
4. Replace any environment variables with custom data.
5. Run `python3 main.py`

I also built a few Django projects. You can check them out at the links below :)<br>

- [Practice Portfolio Site](https://github.com/jai-jk/django-practice-portfolio)<br>

The course was really productive and a great way to learn Python. I was guided through concepts and skills every day and then given a challenge at the end. I completed them all (mostly ðŸ™ƒ) by myself; using the solutions afterwards to check my code quality.

Some projects include the practice work I did during the day as part of their directory. Day 13 was just debugging exercises and I forgot to save them, but 99 days of Python doesn't sound quite as cool as 100.

Days 81 - 100 will be in their own repositories as they are proper portfolio projects - all code written by myself (no solutions available). I will add links as I complete them :)
