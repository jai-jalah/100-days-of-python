# 100-days-of-python

100 Python projects - from Beginner to Advanced
[Syllabus](Syllabus.pdf)

This is my progression through:Â https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/

The course was really productive and a great way to learn Python. I was guided through concepts and skills every day and then given a challenge at the end. I completed them all (mostly) by myself, using the solutions afterwards to check my code quality. Some projects include the practice work I did during the day as part of their directory.

You can try out the projects by cloning this project and then running `python3 main.py` in a specific directory, or `python3 file_path`. Projects with environment variables will require you to use your own details.

Days 81 - 100 are in their own repositories as they are professional portfolio projects with all code written by myself (no solutions available). I will add links as I complete them :)
