# 100-days-of-python

100 Python projects - from Beginner to Advanced <br>
[Syllabus](Syllabus.pdf)

This is my progression through:Â https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/

```
Try out the projects by cloning this project and then running `python3 main.py` in a specific directory, or `python3 (directory)/main.py`.

Projects with environment variables will require you to use your own details.
```

The course was really productive and a great way to learn Python. I was guided through concepts and skills every day and then given a challenge at the end. I completed them all (mostly ðŸ™ƒ) by myself; using the solutions afterwards to check my code quality.

Some projects include the practice work I did during the day as part of their directory. Day 13 was just debugging exercises and I forgot to save them, but 99 days of Python doesn't sound quite as cool as 100.

Days 81 - 100 will be in their own repositories as they are proper portfolio projects - all code written by myself (no solutions available). I will add links as I complete them :)
