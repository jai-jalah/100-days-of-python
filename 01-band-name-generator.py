#My version of a band-name generator.

#1. Create a greeting for your program.
print("Welcome! You're looking for a band name, huh? You've come to the right place!")
#2. Ask the user for the city that they grew up in.
city = input("Tell me then, what city did you grow up in?\n")
#3. Ask the user for the name of a pet.
pet = input("Hmm, nice place I hear. Alright, well what's your lovely lil pet's name hmmm??\n")
#4. Combine the name of their city and pet and show them their band name.
print("Touch√©! Your band name is " + city + " " + pet + " after all...")
#5. Make sure the input cursor shows on a new line, see the example at:
